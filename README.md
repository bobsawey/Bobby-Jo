# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, our name is Bobby Jo

I am a mathematician goaling toward a return to academia to research and study Mathematical and Computational Linguisticsâ€“â€“domains I've found have stuck to my daily, weekly, monthly experiences off and on since highschool :)

Currently researching and very much building private, no know, personal graphing tools and apps that lean heavily on novel and somehow complex solutions for "organizing" data using the harsh simplicity presented by flat ontologies as the primary approaches for document inseration and mutations. Our current app + platform tech is backed by tiny doses of help from large NLP models in the place you and I find ourselves recording our private rich media. In this way, it is immediately ready to be leveraged by other systems with parsing smarts for things like daily briefings--this is my current primary use; my system briefs me on the items left in the system from the day before and we walk through the summaries and make decisions on how to handle those items: archive, push, update, draft addition related but not linked documents to revisit another time, schedule for review at furture arbitrary date that isn't tomorrow, trash it, etc. This helps a dyslexic as myself speak with my system to hash through things, whilst still discovering the most surprising perspectives hiding in my graph. All because there is no firmly assigned special-ness to not one document. Seriously, in my experience these approaches bring great suprises of unique personal insights about ourselves and the undeniable but easily forgotten interdepence with our communities, planet, and all the other the moving parts some of us consider to be a significant chunk of chaw in our waking lives. My personal productivity has increased by something like 4000% every month since July of last year, and I hope

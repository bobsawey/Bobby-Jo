# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, our name is Bobby Jo

quick disclosure: *A machine was utilized to assist with editing and condensing the previous versions of my bio below. Most words are my own. The arrangement and quantity of content was significantly revised by prior mentioned non-human.*

I am a mathematician who researches Computational Math and Linguistics. I am currently working on personal and private graphing tools / apps that utilize novel solutions for "organizing" data. My personal primary use for these tools at the moment involves dumping data and content from various sources throughout my day into my graph. 

Many mornings these days I use another tool I'm working on that has a purely speech-driven conversational interface. This tool provides me with a digest of the previous day's content. 

This helps dyslexics like myself stay on top of things whilst consistently waking up to new and surprising insights and unexpected and welcome perspectives into my life.

Things that I've often forgotten I'd inserted into my graph are told back to me in new ways and with a different order and arrangement that provides value I may have missed had I not revisited the content from the previous day.

Even then, when I revisit these sorts of records without the aid of my morning briefing, I often miss some real nuggets of personal value and discovery. Hard to admit, but apparently I like myself just as much as I like everybody else; there is no denying it: countless times now, I've heard my own story told differently and became enthusiastic just swiftly enough to out-pace my inner-bleh machine that constantly robs me of my basic experience things without so much EXTRA-ness.

There's more, but.. maybe a proper future post on medium or p-blog.

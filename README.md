I am a software engineer, mathematician, artist, and all other super great type of person things, who enjoys Computational Math and Linguistics and other great things.
And I like all the other cool kid stuff too..you know: Systems Theory / System Dynamics / Train Simulator 2022.

Much of my week is currently budgeted toward designing and building personal graphing tools that lean heavily into flat ontologies to facilitate betterliving through Better living through Sociocybernetics( ask me how! )

Currently KonMari-ing my Github and disorganized digital piles of source code scattered across my storage devices over the years.
